        "Brew the espresso and let it cool. For the best tasting tiramisu, choose high quality fresh coffee beans.",

        "Place a ^medium saucepan$ on the stove, and add water and sugar. Cook the mixture over medium heat until the sugar is fully dissolved and it comes to a boil. Remove from heat.",
        "Beat the egg yolks just until the yolks are broken up using a ^hand mixer$. While mixing, <b>slowly drizzle</b> in <b>half</b> of the sugar syrup into the mixture. Beat the mixture until it turns pale yellow and doubles in volume.",
        "Add the mascarpone cheese a few tablespoons at a time. Continue beating until a smooth consistency is achieved.",
        "In the medium bowl with the egg whites, begin beating the egg whites using a cleaned hand mixer. Beat until it begins to get slightly frothy. Slowly drizzle in the remaining sugar syrup while beating. Beat until <b>stiff peaks</b> are formed.",
        "Fold in about â…” of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Add in small portions until desired consistency. <b>Do not use all as it can become too liquid.</b> <i>Try to be as gentle as possible to not crush the light texture of the egg whites.</i>", 
        "Put the cream mixture in the fridge for at least half an hour.",
        "Add the espresso into a ^shallow dish$. Quickly dip a ladyfinger into the espresso and place in a ^8x8 inch square pan$. Create one layer of ladyfingers.",
        "Spread <b>half</b> the cream mixture on top using an ^offset spatula$. Repeat a layer of ladyfingers then cream.",
        "Dust the top of the tiramisu with the cocoa powder using a ^sieve$.",
        "<b>Refrigerate overnight before serving.</b> <i>This will help the flavors all come together and soak in.</i> If you would like to get the striped design cut some parchment paper into small strips, place on top of the cream and then dust with cocoa."
