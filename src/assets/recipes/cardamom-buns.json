    "subtitle": "This unique twist on a classic dessert is the perfect warm treat! The cardamom flavor works perfectly with the warm vanilla cream cheese glaze.",
    "subtitle2": "This is a new dessert in my house! My mom absolutely loves cardamom as it is a flavor she grew up with in India. Using my cinnamon rolls recipe I substituted the cinnamon for this Indian spice to come up with something new. This was an absolute hit in my family. The sweet yeasty brioche flavor balances the cardamom flavor combined with the creamy sweet frosting. TThe recipe itself is not too hard but will require a stand mixer and some basic dough knowledge.",

Knead for 5-7 minutes or until the dough is elastic and smooth. <i>The dough should be tacky and will still be sticking to the sides of the bowl. That's ok!

        "Bake at 375°F for 20-22 minutes, until the rols are lightly golden brown and the center buns are cooked through. <i>Note…the time will vary based on how big the buns are, what type of pan, how close the buns are packed, etc</i>. They could take up to 25-27 minutes. Check the buns at 20 minutes. If they are getting too browned, cover loosely with foil for the remaining baking time.",
