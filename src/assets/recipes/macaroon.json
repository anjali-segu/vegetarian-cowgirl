        "Remove from heat, and slowly drizzle into the ^stand mixer$ with the beaten egg while beating on low speed.",
        "Mix on high for about 3 min or until the bowl is cool and <b>stiff peaks form</b>. You should be able to turn the bowl upside down without the meringue falling out.",
        "<b>Fold the meringue into the almond-sugar paste mixture</b>. Use your spatula to press onto the sides of the bowl to remove any lumps.",
        "Mix until you have a smooth batter that runs off of the spatula slowly in a thick ribbon",

        "<b>To make the raspberry rose jam</b>, place raspberries, granulated sugar, water, and pinch of salt in a saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium heat. Using a spoon mash up the raspberries. Let the mixture come to a boil and thicken. We want the jam to be quite thick so it doesn't spread. Remove from heat and add the rose water.",
        "<b>To assemble</b>, first pair up all of the macaron halves. Next use a little buttercream and spread on both the top and bottom macaron using a butter knife. Pipe little dots of buttercream around the perimeter of the bottom macaron, leaving a hole in the center. Spoon a little jam into the center. Place the top cookie.",
        "<b>Refridgerate in an air-tight container for at least 1-2 days before serving.</b> <i>This allows the cookies to absorb a little bit of the flavors. Trust me it is worth it!</i>"
