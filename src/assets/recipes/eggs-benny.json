    "subtitle": "This classic brunch favorite is given a little spin to make it a bit healthier and lighter.",
    "subtitle2": "Every single time I go to brunch, I always get the eggs benedict. I love the creamy hollandaise enveloping the poached eggs on 2 pieces of warm english muffins. This recipe takes all of those components and makes it a bit healthier. The avocado hollandaise is vegan and much lighter than the traditional yolk based hollandaise.",

        "Saute the spinach with the remaining !oil-spinach in a pan. Cook until spinach is completely wilted and most of the water has evaporated. ",
        "For the eggs, in a large pan (at least 4 inch walls) fill it ¾ full of water. Place on heat and bring to a simmer",
        "<b>To create perfect poached eggs</b>, crack the egg into a strainer. Let some of the thinner egg whites drain off. Place the egg that is in the strainer into a small bowl. Repeat for each egg.",
        "Slowly lower each egg into the water, keep them at least 1 inch apart. In my 14 inch pan I can normally fit 5 eggs.",
        "Cook for 2 minutes. Use a spider strainer and remove each egg. Repeat until all eggs are poached.",
        "For plating, divide the spinach and tomatoes evenly among the pieces of toast. Top each with 2 eggs. Drizzle on the avocado hollandaise. Top with seasoning of choice (chili flakes or everything bagel seasoning). This dish pairs well with hash browns (I did sweet potato hash browns)."
