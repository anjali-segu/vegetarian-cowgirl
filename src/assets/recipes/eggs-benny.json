        "<b>For the Hollandaise</b>, add lemon juice, avocado, water, salt, pepper, chili powder, and garlic powder to a high powered blender (Vitamix).",
        "Start the machine and increase to highest speed. <b>Blend for 30 seconds.</b>",
        "Reduce the speed. Remove the lid plug and <b>slowly drizzle oil</b> through the lid plug opening.",
        "Close the lid plug, and increase to highest speed. Blend for 15 seconds or until descired consistency is reached. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed",
        "<b>For the veggies</b>, cut the cherry tomatoes into halves and toss with !oil-tomato. Place on baking tray with parchment paper. <b>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until tomatoes are crispy and bursting</b>. ",
        "Saute the spinach with the remaining !oil-spinach in a pan. Cook until spinach is completely wilted and most of the water has evaporated. ",
        "For the eggs, in a large pan (at least 4 inch walls) fill it ¾ full of water. Place on heat and bring to a simmer",
        "<b>To create perfect poached eggs</b>, crack the egg into a strainer. Let some of the thinner egg whites drain off. Place the egg that is in the strainer into a small bowl. Repeat for each egg.",
        "Slowly lower each egg into the water, keep them at least 1 inch apart. In my 14 inch pan I can normally fit 5 eggs.",
        "Cook for 2 minutes. Use a spider strainer and remove each egg. Repeat until all eggs are poached.",
        "For plating, divide the spinach and tomatoes evenly among the pieces of toast. Top each with 2 eggs. Drizzle on the avocado hollandaise. Top with seasoning of choice (chili flakes or everything bagel seasoning). This dish pairs well with hash browns (I did sweet potato hash browns)."
