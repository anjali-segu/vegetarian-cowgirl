    "subtitle2": "This is a classic dessert in my house! The cinnamon flavor comes through beautifully without being too strong. The sweet yeasty brioche flavor balances the cinnamon flavor combined with the creamy sweet frosting. These cinnamon buns are not too sweet and warms up beautifully. The recipe itself is not too hard but will require a stand mixer and some basic dough knowledge.",

        "Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach the dough hook.",
        "Beat the dough on medium speed, adding in up to !dough-flour-extra to form a dough. Knead for 5-7 minutes or until the dough is elastic and smooth. <i>The dough should be tacky and will still be sticking to the sides of the bowl. That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more flour at this point. We generally add about 4 ½ cups, but start with 4 cups.</i>",

Then turn off the oven and place the dough to rise in there. It normally takes about 30 minutes for the dough to rise. Do not allow the dough to rise too much or your cinnamon rolls will be airy.",
        "While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside.",
        "Sprinkle a ^silicone mat$ generously with flour. Turn out the dough onto the pastry mat and sprinkle the top of the dough with additional flour.",

        "<b>Preheat the oven to 375°F</b>.",
        "Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don't make it hot, you just don't want it cold. It should be warm to the touch.",
        "Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls.",
        "Bake at 375°F for 20-22 minutes, until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. <i>Note…the time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc</i>. They could take up to 25-27 minutes. Check the rolls at 20 minutes. If they are getting too browned, cover loosely with foil for the remaining baking time.",
