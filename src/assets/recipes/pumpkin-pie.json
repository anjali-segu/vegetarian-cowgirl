    "subtitle": "This pumpkin pie has a perfectly spice creamy filling, a flakey crust that is also tender. Topped with maple whipped cream, this pie is a guarenteed success at Thanksgiving.",
    "subtitle2": "A few things that set this pie apart is the condensed milk and measuring out the spices. Sweetened condensed milk adds a decadent richness to the custard, while measuring the spices instead of using a premixed “pumpkin spice” blend, lets you hit just the right ratio to really highlight the flavors of the canned pumpkin purée.",
